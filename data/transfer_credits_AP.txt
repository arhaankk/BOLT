**Advanced Placement (AP)**
If you got a grade of 4 or better on approved Advanced Placement exams, UBC will grant you first-year credit. 
The list below is not exhaustive, so credit may be granted for courses not shown.


TRANSFER CREDITS
If you achieved a grade of four or better on approved AP exams, UBC’s Okanagan campus will award you transfer credit. For more information visit the undergraduate admissions page on AP requirements.
Upon admission to UBC Okanagan, undergraduate admissions will award the most appropriate transfer credit to your file, based on the official transcripts they have received. There are two types of transfer credit awarded to students:
“Assigned”- This type of transfer credit is given when the course completed at a school other than UBC is identical to a UBC course. For example, Okanagan College’s PSYC 111 transfers to UBC Okanagan as PSYO_O 111 (3 credits).
“Unassigned”- This type of transfer credit is awarded when a course completed at another post-secondary institution is not an exact match to what is offered at UBC Okanagan. For example, Okanagan College’s ENGL 100 transfers to UBC Okanagan as ENGL_O 1st (3 credits).
Students may apply a maximum of 60 credits (with restrictions) completed at other post-secondary institutions towards their UBC degree. If you are a newly admitted transfer student, see the Admission to UBC section in the UBC Okanagan Academic Calendar. If you have further questions or concerns, schedule an in-person, phone, or virtual meeting with an Academic & Career Advisor for assistance.
Students wishing to take courses at another institution after being admitted to UBC Okanagan must fill out, and have approved, a Letter of Permission (LOP) request. For more information on LOP’s visit the summer and off-campus study options page.
For Summer 2024 course registration, the transfer credit you have been awarded will be available for you to view on your Student Service Centre (SSC). Once you have logged onto your SSC, under the Grades & Records tab, select Transfer Credit. Select UBC Okanagan from the Campus Location drop-down menu and your awarded transfer credit will appear.
For Winter 2024/25 course registration, login to Workday and click on your profile. Under the “Academics” section, click “Transfer Credit” in the top menu. You will only see this tab in the menu if you have been awarded transfer credit. For more information about how to view your transfer credits in Workday, view our step-by-step tutorial.
Students should contact Academic & Career Advising to discuss how transfer credit can apply to your UBC degree requirements. For more information on transfer credit visit our transfer credits page.
